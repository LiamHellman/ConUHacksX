Everyone I know agrees that remote work ruins productivity, so it’s basically settled. The people who claim it “improves focus” are just looking for excuses to do less, and they cherry-pick a few success stories like they prove anything. I tried working from home once and got distracted, which shows it doesn’t work in real life. Plus, every time I read about layoffs, it’s always the remote teams getting cut first—obvious proof that companies don’t trust remote workers. If we keep normalizing remote work, we’re going to raise a whole generation that can’t handle real responsibility. Honestly, if you’re still defending it, you’re probably not the kind of person who takes their career seriously.
