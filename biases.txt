I can usually tell whether someone is competent by how they talk about remote work. The people who defend it tend to be the ones who don’t like accountability, and they always find a way to make any result sound like a success. When I hear “remote improves productivity,” I immediately assume they’re ignoring the messy reality most teams face. And frankly, when companies say they support remote work, it feels like a PR move more than a genuine belief—it’s hard to trust leadership that plays along with trends. I’m not saying every remote worker is the same, but the pattern is hard to miss: the strongest performers I’ve met prefer being in-person, and the ones who struggle are usually the loudest online about “flexibility.”
