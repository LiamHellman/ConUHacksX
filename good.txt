There are reasonable arguments on both sides of late-night screen time limits. Some students report better sleep and improved morning attention when their phone use is reduced, while others may rely on devices for legitimate needs like after-hours work, family communication, or accessibility tools. The effectiveness of limits likely depends on how they’re implemented (e.g., opt-in settings, parental guidance, and clear exceptions) and on individual differences. Before adopting any policy, it would be helpful to review evidence from controlled studies or school pilot programs and to define measurable outcomes (sleep duration, tardiness, grades, self-reported wellbeing) over a specific time window. A policy that is transparent, reversible, and evaluated against clear metrics would reduce unintended harms and make the decision easier to assess.
