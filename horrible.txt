Either we enforce strict rules on how people study and use technology or we should just admit education is a lost cause. Everyone knows students today are distracted all the time, and if you’ve met even a few of them, it’s obvious none of them can focus without being forced. If we allow even a small amount of flexibility—like optional recorded lectures or relaxed screen-time guidelines—then students will inevitably stop showing up, then they’ll stop learning, then they’ll stop caring, and soon the entire university will basically become a glorified daycare. And once universities turn into daycares, employers will stop trusting degrees, then the economy will collapse, and after that society won’t have enough competent people to run hospitals, bridges, or even basic services. At that point, we’ll have no choice but to introduce monitoring software, mandatory attendance tracking, and standardized behavior rules, because otherwise the system will fall apart. So the choice is simple: total strictness now, or total chaos later. I’ve seen how it goes—my friend skipped a couple lectures once and then started procrastinating, which proves this is the path we’re on. If we don’t draw the line immediately, we’re basically voting for collapse.
