I think universities should move more classes to recorded lectures because it clearly helps students learn better. Most people I know say they understand material more easily when they can pause and replay, so it’s probably true for the average student. And since my grades improved during the semester I relied heavily on recordings, that suggests recordings are a main reason students do better. Some critics argue that recordings reduce attendance, but that feels overstated—if the content is good, students will stay engaged either way. Plus, schools that emphasize flexible learning tend to sound more student-centered, which is the direction higher education should be moving in.
