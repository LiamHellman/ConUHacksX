If you support any limits on late-night screen time, you’re basically saying you want to control everyone’s life like a dictator. Either we let people use their phones whenever they want or we might as well ban the internet entirely—there’s no middle ground. And honestly, the only people who push “screen time rules” are out-of-touch busybodies who probably don’t even understand technology. Everyone I know agrees that these rules are pointless, so it’s obvious they don’t work. My cousin stopped using his phone after 9 p.m. and immediately got worse grades, which proves these restrictions harm students. Plus, once schools start recommending screen limits, the next step is mandatory device checks, then surveillance apps, and soon you won’t be allowed to message anyone without permission. If we don’t stop this now, freedom is basically over.
