Let’s be honest: only someone completely out of touch would oppose this policy. If you don’t support it, you’re basically saying you’re fine with families suffering. We don’t have time for “debate” while people are hurting—this needs to pass now. And if you think the costs are too high, ask yourself: what price do you put on safety? Everyone sensible is already on board; the only resistance comes from special interests trying to protect their profits. If we don’t act immediately, things will spiral—first it’s a small delay, then it’s chaos, and before you know it we’ll be living in a society where nothing is safe. Choose wisely.
